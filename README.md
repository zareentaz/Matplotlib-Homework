# Matplotlib-Homework

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation

Our objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, We will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type


Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Our objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this you are tasked with:

Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
